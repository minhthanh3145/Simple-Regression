# Simple-Regression
Simple Regression Assignment - First week of "Machine Learning: Regression" course on Coursera.

# What I did:
- Use graphlab SArray and SFrame functions to compute important summary statistics.
- Write a function to compute the Simple Linear Regression weights using the closed form solution.
- Write a function to make predictions of the output given the input feature.
- Turn the regression around to predict the input given the output.
- Compare two different models for predicting house prices.
